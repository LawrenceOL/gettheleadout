          <p>Since Flint, Michigan's water crisis hit  headlines in 2015, we woke up to the serious health risk lead pipes pose. Through reseach we found that every state in the nation has lead problems. However, folks rarely know their exposure risk as inventory of locations of lead service lines (LSL) have never been mandated, until recently, and records have not been well-kept initiatives across the U.S.</p>

              </h1>

              <p>
                With the passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, states now have the opportunity to access funding for lead pipe replacement. But often communities with the greatest need, have the fewest resources to conduct inventories which are critical to applying for funding. Mapping lines requires the cooperation of both public utilities and residents.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  To help small communities, with limited resources create inventories, we envisioned a map that utilized crowd-sources data and open-source data to engage communities in collective participation in the LSL mapping. We hope it educates and empowers residents, provides information that cities can use for funding, and provides open-source data for academics and researchers to utilize in tackling clean water initiatives across the U.S.

                Our Data Team used two data sets to analyze the city of Hazel Crest, IL and predict whether or not an address was likely to have LSL.

                <p> 
                 The variables with the strongest negative correlations were the estimated year of construction, median household income, size of the home (square feet), and the market value of the home. That means as each of these variables decreases the probability of lead increases. 
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                  Our goal is to encourage open source data reporting through our survey to help communities more accurately target their lead problems.

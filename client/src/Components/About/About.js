          Since Flint, Michigan's water crisis hit headlines in 2015, we woke up
          to the serious health risk lead pipes pose. Through reseach we found
          that every state in the nation has lead problems. &nbsp; However,
          folks rarely know their exposure risk as inventory of locations of
          lead service lines (LSL) have never been mandated, until recently, and
          records have not been well-kept initiatives across the U.S.

            With the passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, states now
            have the opportunity to access funding for lead pipe replacement.
            &nbsp; But often communities with the greatest need, have the fewest
            resources to conduct inventories which are critical to applying for
            funding. &nbsp; Mapping lines requires the cooperation of both
            public utilities and residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help small communities, with limited resources create
            inventories, we envisioned a map that utilized crowd-sources data
            and open-source data to engage communities in collective
            participation in the LSL mapping. &nbsp; We hope it educates and
            empowers residents, provides information that cities can use for
            funding, and provides open-source data for academics and researchers
            to utilize in tackling clean water initiatives across the U.S.

            Our Data Team used two data sets to analyze the city of Hazel Crest,
            IL and predict whether or not an address was likely to have LSL.
          </p>
          <p>
            The variables with the strongest negative correlations were the
            estimated year of construction, median household income, size of the
            home (square feet), and the market value of the home. &nbsp; That
            means as each of these variables decreases the probability of lead
            increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to encourage open source data reporting through our
            survey to help communities more accurately target their lead
            problems.
